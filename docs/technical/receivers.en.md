# Receivers and SDR

The receiver is the "ears" of your station. Today we distinguish between classic analog receivers and modern SDR (Software Defined Radio).

## Types of Receivers

### Analog (Superheterodyne)
*   Classic design with frequency mixing.
*   Excellent selectivity, but more expensive to manufacture.

### SDR (Software Defined Radio)
A radio where most signal processing (modulation, demodulation, filtering) is done in software.
*   **Pros**: Flexibility, panoramic display (waterfall), ability to decode various digital signals.
*   **Cons**: Computer dependency, sometimes poorer dynamic range in cheap models.

## Popular SDR Devices

If you want a cheap entry into the world of radio monitoring, SDR is the best choice.

*   [**RTL-SDR V4**](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/buy-rtl-sdr-dvb-t-dongles/): The most popular "entry-level" SDR. Originally a TV tuner, modified for hams. Price around 30-40 USD.
*   [**Airspy HF+ Discovery**](https://airspy.com/airspy-hf-discovery/): Superb reception on Shortwave (HF). Excellent dynamic range.
*   [**SDRplay RSP1B**](https://www.sdrplay.com/rsp1b/): Wideband receiver (1 kHz - 2 GHz) with excellent software (SDRuno).
*   [**HackRF One**](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/): For advanced users and experimentation (can also transmit low power).

## SDR Software
*   [**SDR# (SDR Sharp)**](https://airspy.com/download/): Simplest to start with (Windows).
*   [**SDR++**](https://www.sdrpp.org/): Excellent open-source software (Windows, Linux, Mac).
*   [**HDSDR**](http://www.hdsdr.de/): Lightweight and fast.
