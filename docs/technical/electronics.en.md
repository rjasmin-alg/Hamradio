# Basics of Electronics

Understanding electronics is fundamental for every radio amateur.

## Basic Components

### Resistor

Limits the flow of electric current. Think of it as a narrowing in a pipe through which water flows.

*   **Unit**: Ohm ($\Omega$)
*   **Symbol**: $R$
*   **Usage**: Voltage adjustment, current limiting for LEDs.

### Capacitor

Stores electrical energy in an electric field. Works like a small battery that can charge and discharge very quickly.

*   **Unit**: Farad ($F$) - in practice $\mu F$, $nF$, $pF$ are used.
*   **Symbol**: $C$
*   **Usage**: Voltage filtering (smoothing), resonant circuits, blocking DC current.

### Inductor

Stores energy in a magnetic field. Opposes any change in current.

*   **Unit**: Henry ($H$) - usually $\mu H$, $mH$.
*   **Symbol**: $L$
*   **Usage**: Resonant circuits, chokes (blocking HF signals), transformers.

### Semiconductors

#### Diode

Electronic check valve. Allows current to flow in only one direction.

*   **Symbol**: $D$
*   **Usage**: Rectifying AC to DC (rectifiers), signal detection.

#### Transistor

Active component that can amplify signals or act as an electronic switch. The foundation of all modern devices.

*   **Types**: Bipolar (BJT), Unipolar (FET, MOSFET).
*   **Symbol**: $Q$ or $TR$
*   **Usage**: Amplifiers, oscillators, switches.

## Ohm's Law

The fundamental law of electrical engineering describing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance.

$$ I = \frac{U}{R} $$

Where:
*   $I$ = Current (Ampere - $A$)
*   $U$ = Voltage (Volt - $V$)
*   $R$ = Resistance (Ohm - $\Omega$)

## Power

$$ P = U \cdot I $$

*   $P$ = Power (Watt - $W$)
