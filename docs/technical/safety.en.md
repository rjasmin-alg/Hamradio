# Safety

Safety comes first! Radio amateurs work with high voltages and electromagnetic radiation.

## Electrical Safety

- **Grounding**: All metal parts of equipment should be grounded to a common point.
- **Fuses**: Use appropriate fuses on power supplies.
- **Antennas**: Never touch an antenna while transmitting! Voltages of several thousand volts can develop at the ends of a dipole.

## Lightning Protection

- **Disconnecting**: The best protection is physically disconnecting the antenna from the radio when not in use (especially in summer).
- **Surge Arrestors**: Help with static electricity but do not guarantee protection against a direct hit.

## RF Exposure (EMF)

- **Safe Distances**: Keep antennas away from people.
- **Non-ionizing Radiation**: Radio waves do not damage DNA like X-rays, but can cause tissue heating at high power.
- **Eyes**: Particularly sensitive to heating (UHF/Microwaves).
