# Antennas and Feedlines

The antenna is the most important part of any radio station. A bad antenna on an expensive radio performs worse than a good antenna on a cheap radio.

## Antenna Types

### Dipole
The simplest and very efficient antenna.
- Consists of two wires with a total length of $\lambda/2$ (half wavelength).
- Example for 20m (14 MHz): Total length about 10m.

### Yagi-Uda (Beam)
Directional antenna that amplifies the signal in one direction.
- Consists of a dipole (driven element), reflector, and directors.
- Used for DX work as it "focuses" energy.

### Vertical (Ground Plane)
Omnidirectional antenna (radiates in all directions).
- Good for local contacts (VHF/UHF) and DX on lower frequencies if it has a good ground system.

## Feedlines

### Coaxial Cable
The most commonly used feedline.
- **RG-58**: Thin, for shorter runs and lower power.
- **RG-213**: Thicker, lower loss, for higher power.
- **Impedance**: Standard is 50 $\Omega$.

### SWR (Standing Wave Ratio)
Measure of impedance matching between antenna and feedline.
- **1:1**: Perfect.
- **up to 1.5:1**: Excellent.
- **over 2:1**: Tuning required or use of a tuner.
