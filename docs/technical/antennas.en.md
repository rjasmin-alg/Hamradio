# Antennas and Feedlines

The antenna is the most important part of any radio station. A bad antenna on an expensive radio performs worse than a good antenna on a cheap radio.

## Antenna Types

### Dipole

The simplest and very efficient antenna.
*   Consists of two wires with a total length of $\lambda/2$ (half wavelength).
*   Example for 20m (14 MHz): Total length about 10m.

### Yagi-Uda (Beam)

Directional antenna that amplifies the signal in one direction.
*   Consists of a dipole (driven element), reflector, and directors.
*   Used for DX work as it "focuses" energy (like a lens for light).

### Vertical (Ground Plane)

Omnidirectional antenna (radiates in all directions).
*   Good for local contacts (VHF/UHF) and DX on lower frequencies if it has a good ground system (radials).

## Feedlines

### Coaxial Cable

The most commonly used feedline.
*   **RG-58**: Thin, for shorter runs and lower power.
*   **RG-213**: Thicker, lower loss, for higher power.
*   **Impedance**: Standard is 50 $\Omega$.

### SWR (Standing Wave Ratio)
Measure of impedance matching between antenna and feedline.
*   **1:1**: Perfect.
*   **up to 1.5:1**: Excellent.
*   **over 2:1**: Tuning required or use of a tuner.

## Antenna Simulators
Antenna modeling software allows you to "build" an antenna on your computer and see how it will perform before cutting a single wire.
