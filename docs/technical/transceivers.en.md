Small, portable devices with their own battery and antenna.
*   **Most common bands**: 2m (144 MHz) and 70cm (432 MHz).
*   **Pros**: Cheap, mobile, great for local communication and repeater work.
*   **Cons**: Low power (usually 5W), short range with the "rubber duck" antenna.

*   **Pros**: Comfort, high power, advanced noise filtering features.
*   **Note**: Requires external power supply (13.8V).

### Mobile Radios
Designed for installation in vehicles.
*   Usually VHF/UHF for FM operation, but HF mobile stations exist (e.g., Icom IC-7000 series).
*   Higher power than HTs (50W).

## Accessories

*   **Power Supply**: Converts mains voltage to 13.8V DC.
*   **SWR Meter**: Instrument for measuring antenna matching.
*   **Antenna Tuner (ATU)**: Device matches antenna impedance to the radio.
