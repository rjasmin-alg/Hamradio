# QSO Procedures

Making a contact has its rules to ensure efficient and understandable communication.

## Basic Terms

- **CQ**: General call ("Calling Any Station").
- **DE**: From (used in CW or digital modes).
- **K**: Over.
- **73**: Best Regards.

## Example Contact (SSB)

1.  **Call**: "CQ CQ CQ, this is 9A1AA, 9A1AA calling and listening."
2.  **Reply**: "9A1AA, this is DL1BBB."
3.  **Report**: "DL1BBB, good day. Your signal is 59 (five-nine), name is Ivan, locator JN75. 9A1AA."
4.  **Confirmation**: "9A1AA, thanks Ivan. Your signal is also 59, my name is Hans. 73!"
5.  **End**: "Thanks Hans, 73 and hope to hear you again. DL1BBB de 9A1AA."

## RST System

The report consists of 3 digits (for CW) or 2 (for SSB):
- **R (Readability)**: 1-5.
- **S (Signal Strength)**: 1-9.
- **T (Tone)**: 1-9 (CW only).

Example: **599** (Perfect signal on CW).

## Q-Codes

Q-codes are standardized three-letter codes starting with the letter Q. Originally developed for telegraphy to speed up communication, they are now also used in voice modes.
