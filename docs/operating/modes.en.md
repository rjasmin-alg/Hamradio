# Modes

Radio amateurs use different types of modulation to transmit information. Each mode has its pros, cons, and specific "sound".

## CW (Continuous Wave / Telegraphy)

The oldest form of communication. Uses Morse code (dots and dashes).
*   **Pros**: Range (gets through when nothing else can), simple equipment, narrow bandwidth.
*   **Sound**: Rhythmic beeping.

## SSB (Single Sideband)

The most popular mode for voice on Shortwave (HF). An advanced version of AM that uses less energy.
*   **LSB (Lower Sideband)**: Used below 10 MHz (40m, 80m).
*   **USB (Upper Sideband)**: Used above 10 MHz (20m, 17m...) and on VHF/UHF.
*   **Sound**: Human voice, but sounds like "Donald Duck" if you are not exactly on frequency.

## FM (Frequency Modulation)
Standard for local contacts on VHF/UHF (handhelds).
*   **Pros**: Clear sound, no noise (if signal is strong).
*   **Cons**: Requires wide bandwidth, shorter range compared to SSB/CW.

## Digital Modes (FT8, RTTY...)

Computer and radio working together.
*   **FT8**: Currently the most popular mode. Allows contacts with very low power and inaudible signals. The contact is automated.
*   **RTTY (Teletype)**: Older digital mode, sounds like an "80s video game".
*   **FT8 Sound**: Sounds like multiple tones warbling.

## Waterfall Display
Modern radios and software display signals visually.
*   **X Axis**: Frequency.
*   **Y Axis**: Time.
*   **Color**: Signal strength.
*   Allows you to "see" stations before you hear them.
