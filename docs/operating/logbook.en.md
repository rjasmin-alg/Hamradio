# Logbooks and QSL Cards

Every contact made should be logged. This is a legal requirement and part of the tradition.

## Logbook

The logbook must contain:
- Date and time (UTC).
- Correspondent's call sign.
- Frequency (or band).
- Mode.
- Report (RST).

### Paper vs. Electronic
Today, most use computer programs (loggers) such as N1MM, DXKeeper, or Ham Radio Deluxe. They automatically record time and frequency (if connected to the radio).

## QSL Cards

A QSL card is a written confirmation of a contact. It is the "final courtesy" of a ham.
- **Paper QSL**: Sent directly by mail or (cheaper) via the national association's QSL bureau.
- **Electronic QSL**:
    - **LoTW (Logbook of The World)**: ARRL system. Officially recognized for awards (DXCC).
    - **eQSL**: Popular, but less "official".
    - **ClubLog**: Excellent for analysis and OQRS (Online QSL Request System).
