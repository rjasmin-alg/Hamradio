# How to Become a Ham?

The path to an amateur radio license involves passing an examination. In Croatia, there are two classes of amateur radio operators: **P** (Entry Level) and **A** (Advanced).

## Amateur Radio Classes

### Class P (Entry Level)
This is the entry point into the world of amateur radio.
- **Privileges**: Operation on all amateur frequency bands, but with limited power (up to 100W on HF, up to 50W on VHF/UHF).
- **Exam**: Simpler, focused on the basics of regulations, technical topics, and operating procedures.
- **Recommendation**: Ideal for beginners who want to get on the air quickly.

### Class A (Advanced)
Full amateur radio privileges.
- **Privileges**: Operation with maximum legal power (up to 1.5 kW in some cases) and access to all international privileges (CEPT HAREC).
- **Exam**: More comprehensive, includes deeper knowledge of electronics and radio theory.
- **Recommendation**: For those who want to utilize the full potential of the hobby.

## Examination Process

1.  **Preparation**:
    *   Find the nearest radio club ([Club List](../community/index.en.md)). Clubs often organize courses.
    *   Download manuals and question pools from the [HRS website](https://www.hamradio.hr/).
2.  **Application**:
    *   Exams are organized in radio clubs or directly at the HRS.
3.  **The Exam**:
    *   Consists of a written part (test). There is no longer a practical part (Morse code is not mandatory).

## After the Exam

After successfully passing the exam, you receive an **Examination Certificate**. With this, you apply to HAKOM for a **License to use RF spectrum** and the allocation of a **call sign**.
