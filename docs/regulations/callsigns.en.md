# Call Signs

A call sign is a unique identifier for an amateur radio station.

## Structure (Croatia)

Croatian call signs consist of three parts:

1.  **Prefix**: `9A` (indicates Croatia).
2.  **Number**: `1` - `9` (historically indicated region, today mostly arbitrary but often follows: 1-Zagreb, 2-Dalmatia, 3-Istria/Littoral, 4-Slavonia...). `0` is used for special signs.
3.  **Suffix**: 1, 2, or 3 letters.
    *   **1 letter**: Clubs with long tradition or special signs (e.g., `9A1A`).
    *   **2 letters**: Standard personal signs (e.g., `9A2AA`) or clubs.
    *   **3 letters**: Standard personal signs (e.g., `9A3AAA`).

## Types of Call Signs

- **Personal Call Signs**: Assigned to individuals after passing the exam.
- **Club Call Signs**: Assigned to radio clubs.
- **Special Call Signs**: For contests, anniversaries, or expeditions (e.g., `9A80Z`, `9A0HQ`).

## Identification

During operation, a ham must regularly transmit their call sign (at the start, end, and every 10-15 minutes during contact).
When operating from another country (CEPT), place that country's prefix before your call sign (e.g., `S5/9A1AA` if in Slovenia).
When operating portable/mobile, add the suffix `/P` (portable), `/M` (mobile), or `/MM` (maritime mobile).
