# International Regulations

Amateur radio is a global hobby, so international coordination is crucial.

## Key Organizations

### ITU (International Telecommunication Union)
The UN agency that coordinates the use of the radio frequency spectrum globally.
- **Radio Regulations (RR)**: International regulations defining the amateur service.

### IARU (International Amateur Radio Union)
Represents the interests of radio amateurs before the ITU.
- Divided into 3 regions:
    1.  **Region 1**: Europe, Africa, Middle East, Northern Asia.
    2.  **Region 2**: The Americas.
    3.  **Region 3**: Rest of Asia, Australia, Oceania.

### CEPT (European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations)
European organization that harmonizes regulations.
- **Recommendation T/R 61-01**: Allows hams with a CEPT license (Class A in Croatia) to operate in other signatory countries without additional bureaucracy (up to 3 months).
- **Recommendation T/R 61-02**: Harmonized Amateur Radio Examination Certificate (HAREC).

## What does this mean for you?
If you pass Class A in Croatia, your license is recognized in most European countries (and many others). You can travel and operate your station using the prefix of the country you are visiting (e.g., DL/9A1AA).
