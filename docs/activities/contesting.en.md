# Contesting

Amateur radio contests are the "sporting" part of the hobby. The goal is to make as many contacts as possible within a given time.

## How does it work?
- **Duration**: From a few hours to 48 hours.
- **Exchange**: Instead of long conversations, only a report (59) and a serial number (or zone, locator) are exchanged.
- **Categories**: Single Operator, Multi Operator, Low Power (QRP), etc.

## Popular Contests
- **CQ WW DX**: The world's largest contest (October SSB, November CW).
- **9A CW Contest**: Croatian contest (December).
- **IOTA Contest**: Island contacts (July).

## Equipment and Software
- Serious results require good antennas and amplifiers.
- Specialized software (N1MM, DXLog) is used, connected to the radio to automatically send CW or voice messages.
