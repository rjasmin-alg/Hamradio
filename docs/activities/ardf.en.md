# Amateur Radio Direction Finding (ARDF)

Also known as "Fox Hunting".

## What is ARDF?
A technical-sports discipline where competitors use a receiver and antenna to find hidden transmitters ("foxes") in nature.

## Categories
- **3.5 MHz (80m)**: Classic discipline. Receivers are simpler.
- **144 MHz (2m)**: More demanding due to signal reflections.

## Equipment
- **Receiver**: Specially designed for ARDF, with a directional antenna (ferrite for 80m, Yagi/HB9CV for 2m).
- **Compass and Map**: For orientation in nature.

ARDF is a great way to learn about wave propagation and enjoy the outdoors. The Croatian national team is one of the most successful in the world!
