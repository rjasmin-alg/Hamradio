# DXing (Long Distance)

DXing is the hunt for distant and rare countries (entities).

## What is DX?
- On Shortwave (HF), DX is usually a contact with another continent.
- On VHF/UHF, DX can be a contact of a few hundred kilometers.

## DXCC List
The ARRL maintains a list of "DXCC entities". These are not always countries; they can be remote islands (e.g., Hawaii, Antarctica). There are currently about 340 of them.
The goal of every DXer is to confirm contacts with all 340 entities.

## How to catch DX?
1.  **Listening**: 90% of DXing is listening.
2.  **DX Cluster**: Websites where others post what they hear (e.g., DX Summit).
3.  **Pile-up**: A situation where hundreds of stations call one rare DX station. Skill and patience are needed to break through.
4.  **Split Operation**: The DX station listens on one frequency and transmits on another (e.g., "UP 5"). Never call on the DX station's frequency if they are working split!
