# Satellite Communications

Radio amateurs have their own satellites in orbit!

## How does it work?
Most amateur satellites are "flying repeaters".
- **Uplink**: Frequency you transmit on (e.g., 435 MHz).
- **Downlink**: Frequency you listen on (e.g., 145 MHz).
- This is called **Mode U/V** (UHF up, VHF down).

## Doppler Effect
Due to the high speed of the satellite, the frequency changes as the satellite approaches and departs. You must constantly correct the receive frequency.

## Equipment
- For FM satellites (e.g., ISS, SO-50), a handheld radio and a small directional antenna (Yagi) held in hand are sufficient.
- For linear satellites (SSB/CW), better equipment and antennas with rotation (azimuth/elevation) are needed.

## ISS (International Space Station)
Astronauts who are hams are often on the ISS. Sometimes they talk to schools (ARISS program) or send SSTV images.
