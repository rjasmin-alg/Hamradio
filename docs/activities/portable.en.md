# Portable Operations

Going out into nature with a radio is one of the most beautiful parts of the hobby.

## SOTA (Summits On The Air)
A program that encourages hams to operate from mountain summits.
- **Activator**: Climbs the summit and makes contacts (must carry all equipment).
- **Chaser**: Collects points by working activators.

## POTA (Parks On The Air)
Similar to SOTA, but operating from national parks and nature reserves.
- More accessible as you can often drive close to the location.
