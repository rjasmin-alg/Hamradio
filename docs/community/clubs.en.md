# Radio Clubs

The radio club is the basic cell of amateur radio. It is a place where enthusiasts gather, exchange experiences, and use common equipment.

## Why join?
- **Equipment**: Clubs often have top-notch radios and antennas that an individual can hardly afford.
- **Education**: Older members (mentors) pass on knowledge to new ones.
- **Socializing**: Amateur radio is a social hobby.

## How to find a club?
The HRS website has a list of all active radio clubs in Croatia.
