# Emergency Procedures

When a disaster strikes, discipline is key.

## Golden Rules
1.  **Listen**: Do not transmit unless called or you have urgent information.
2.  **Short and Clear**: Use the phonetic alphabet. Avoid jargon.
3.  **Write it down**: All messages must be written down (time, sender, content).

## Message Types
- **Mayday / SOS**: Immediate danger to life. Absolute priority.
- **Pan-Pan**: Urgent situation, but no immediate danger to life.
- **Securite**: Safety warning (e.g., weather).

## IARU Emergency Message
A standardized format for sending messages ensuring nothing is lost in transmission.
