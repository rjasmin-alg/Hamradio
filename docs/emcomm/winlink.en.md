# Winlink

Winlink is a global system for sending email via radio. It is crucial in EmComm as it allows sending detailed reports, lists, and images when the internet is down.

## How does it work?
- **User**: Connects a computer to a radio (HF or VHF).
- **Gateway (RMS)**: A radio station connected to the internet that receives the message.
- **CMS**: Central servers (cloud) that forward the mail to the regular internet.

## Advantages
- Works without local internet (via HF you connect to a gateway in another country).
- Supports attachments (images, PDF).
- Integrated with civil protection forms (ICS forms).

## Equipment
- Computer with software (Winlink Express).
- Radio.
- Modem (TNC) or software modem (VARA).
