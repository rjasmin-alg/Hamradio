# CB Equipment

CB equipment is simpler and cheaper than amateur radio gear.

## Radios
- **Mobile**: Most common. Installed in cars or used as base stations with a power supply. (e.g., President, Midland, Albrecht).
- **Handheld**: Shorter range, but practical.

## Antennas
The key to range on 27 MHz (11m wavelength).
- **Mobile Antennas**: Shortened with a coil. The longer, the better (from 1m to 2m). Often magnet-mounted.
- **Base Antennas**: Large verticals (5-7 meters). Allow ranges of 20-50 km locally, and hundreds of km when propagation conditions are good (DX).

## SWR
As with hams, the antenna must be tuned (SWR < 1.5). Most CB antennas have a screw for length adjustment.
