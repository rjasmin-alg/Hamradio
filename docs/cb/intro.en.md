# Introduction to CB (Citizens Band)

CB (Citizens Band) is "radio for the people". Unlike amateur radio, it does not require passing an exam.

## History
Originating in the USA in the 1940s, CB boomed in the 1970s ("Convoy", "Smokey and the Bandit"). In Europe and Croatia, it is popular among truck drivers, off-road enthusiasts, and people who want free short-distance communication.
